# 📖 Project Overview


An interactive **Data Science Web Application** that explores **120 years of Olympic Games data (1896–2016)** through advanced visualizations and analytics.

Built using **Python, Streamlit, and Plotly** to transform raw historical data into actionable insights.







The modern Olympic Games generate massive amounts of athlete and country-level performance data. However, extracting meaningful insights from this data is challenging.

This project solves that problem by providing an **interactive analytics dashboard** that enables users to explore:

- Medal trends over time
- Country-wise performance
- Athlete demographics
- Historical participation patterns

This application demonstrates **end-to-end Data Science workflow**, including:

- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
- Web App Deployment
